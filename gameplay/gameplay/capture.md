# Capture

All Sweepers (players) are equipped with a powerful vacuum cleaner. They can interact with Eggs or Trash Bags to trigger a Capture mode, which prompts a minigame to quickly suck in the NFTs or Game Items. It's each sweeper's duty to vacuum up whatever objects they may find in their surroundings!\
\
Vacuum cleaners require [Cartridges](../resources/game-items/cartridges.md) to be effective in sucking in precious resources. Cartridges are items themselves and can be found around pretty easily. If you run out of Cartridges, chances are you will be able to recharge pretty fast by spotting more of them in your proximity area.

### Capture activites

* Collect and mint Eggs as NFT.
* Collect and mint Trash Objects as NFT.&#x20;
