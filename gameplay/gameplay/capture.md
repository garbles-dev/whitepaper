# Capture

Players can interact with Eggs or Trash Bags to activate Capture mode where they are prompted to solve a quick challenge to successfully collect NFTs or Game Items. Luckily, every good Cleanists is equipped with a powerful vacuum cleaner, and it is their duty to vacuum up whatever  objects they may find in their surroundings!\
\
Vacuum cleaners require enough [Cartridges](../resources/game-items/cartridges.md) to suck in Eggs and Trash Items. Cartridges are items themselves and can be found around pretty easily. If you run out of Cartridges, chances are you can recharge pretty fast by just walking around your proximity area.&#x20;

### Capture activites

* Collect and mint Eggs as NFT.
* Collect and mint Trash Objects as NFT.&#x20;
