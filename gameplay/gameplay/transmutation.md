# Transmutation

[Transmuters](../resources/nft/transmuters.md) are the tool used to generate Garbles. They are impressive pieces of technology but must be energized with enough $NUCLEAR to trigger a reaction. Transmuters can be owned, positioned or exchanged by players and they are limited.&#x20;

There are two ways to activate a reaction. &#x20;

* On-site
* Remote

### On-site

Transmuters have been engineered to activate reactions at great distances, but if you are fortunate enough to locate one on the map the reaction will take way less energy (in $NUCLEAR terms).  Each Transmuter owner will receive 50% of the $NUCLEAR used to activate a reaction when performed by players within their proximity. The other 50% is used to buy-and-burn on-chain carbon credit and remove actual CO2 (thanks to the energy released from garbles eggs ♻️).&#x20;

### Remote

The $NUCLEAR paid to activate a remote reaction will be similarly split 50-50%. Half is used for the buy-and-burn of carbon credits, the other half goes to the Treasury and will be distributed to the Leaderboard on a monthly basis.&#x20;
