# Transmutation

[Transmuters](../resources/nft/transmuters.md) are the powerful machines used to generate Garbles. They are impressive pieces of technology that have been engineered by Cleantists to merge garbage with eggs and ultimately turn waste into Garbles. Transmuters are the only way to carry out the transmutation process in the various life stages of garbles. They can be owned and positioned by Sweepers. Mind that due to their inherent production complexity, they are limited!

\
If you are fortunate enough to locate one on the map, you can mint it as NFT and exert your control over the area. You are entitled to use it in perpetuity and will receive a fee from other Sweepers who need to transmute their garbage but don't own one. \
Transmuters must be energized with enough $NUCLEAR to trigger a reaction. \
Energizing a transmuter means burning a portion of [$NUCLEAR](../tokenomics/usdnuclear.md) in the process. A part of the transaction is used to accumulate [on-chain carbon credits](../resources/c02-tokens.md) that are then sent to the treasury and governed by the GarblesDAO.&#x20;
