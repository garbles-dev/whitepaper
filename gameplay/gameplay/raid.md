# Raid

Raids are missions played with garbles to clean certain territories on the map. Players who are able to successfully complete raids obtain various forms of rewards, including resources and $NUCLEAR.&#x20;

The planet is not only full of garbage, but has become pupulated by filthy creatures that have nothing in common with Garbles!  Sometimes, these nasty piles of garbage can even become huge enough to threaten the whole city.  Players must intervene timely to root out these columns of waste by staking enough Garbles to consume them before the garbage spread further around. Once a pile of trash is exhausted, it releases [Game Items](../resources/game-items/), [Trash Items](../resources/nft/trash-items.md) and [$NUCLEAR](../tokenomics/usdnuclear.md). Different types of trash piles will release relative types of objects (i.e. plastic piles will tend to release plastic-type objects).

Raids can be played with team members from the same Team and in fact, it increases the chance of obtaining rewards. Rewards are split pro-rata according to the contribution of each owns garbles. A global leaderboard keeps track of the score of Teams.&#x20;
