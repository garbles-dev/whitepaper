# Raid

Raids are missions played with garbles to clean areas invaded by a colony of trash-based monsters. These filthy creatures have nothing in common with Garbles! They are incredibly smelly and nasty to say the least. Sometimes, these nasty piles of garbage can even become huge enough to threaten the whole city.  Sweepers must intervene timely to root out these columns of waste by deploying enough Garbles to consume them before the garbage spread further around. Once a pile of trash is exhausted, it releases [Game Items](../resources/game-items/), [Trash Items](../resources/nft/trash-items.md) and [$NUCLEAR](../tokenomics/usdnuclear.md). Different types of trash piles will release relative types of objects (i.e. plastic piles will tend to release plastic-type objects).

Raids can be played with team members from the same Team and in fact, it increases the chance of obtaining rewards. Rewards are split pro-rata according to the contribution of each owns garbles. A global leaderboard keeps track of the score of Teams.&#x20;
