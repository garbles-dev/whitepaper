# Gameplay

Garbles is an immersive AR mobile game that allows players to collect **on-chain carbon credits** while performing actions such as removing trash and generating garbles in the game. \
\
Players can explore their surroundings to collect eggs, waste material and other useful scrap items as NFT. Ultimately they can give birth to an army of adorable, trash-eating Garbles combining trash items. To generate the little creatures a [Transmuter](../resources/#transmuter) is needed. Trasmuters are powerful machines that can turn different types of garbage into the hungry creatures if energized with enough [$NUCLEAR](../resources/#nuclear). The process requires at least an egg and three trash objects, all to be found around our polluted world. The reaction will remove actual CO2 from the environment. After having assembled a litter of garbles, players will then take part in raids against nasty piles of trash that may occasionally spawn in the middle of their city and play daily mini-games to collect [Resources](../resources/) and exciting [Rewards](../resources/game-items/). \
