# Gameplay

Garbles is an AR mobile game that allows players to burn real **on-chain carbon credits** while performing actions such as removing trash and generating garbles in the game. \
\
Players can explore their surroundings, collecting eggs and waste material to ultimately give birth to an army of adorable, trash-eating Garbles. To generate the little creatures a [Transmuter](../resources/#transmuter) is needed. Trasmuters are powerful machines that can turn different types of garbage into the hungry creatures if energized with enough [$NUCLEAR](../resources/#nuclear), the in-game token of the game. The process requires at least an egg and three trash objects, which can be found around our polluted world. The reaction will remove actual CO2 from the environment. After having assembled their own litter of garbles, players can then take part in raids against nasty piles of trash that may occasionally spawn in the middle of their city and play daily mini-games to collect [Resources](../resources/) and other exciting [Rewards](../resources/game-items/). \
