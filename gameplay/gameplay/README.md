# Gameplay

Garbles is an immersive AR mobile game that allows players to collect[ **on-chain carbon credits**](../resources/c02-tokens.md) **** while performing actions in the game such as removing trash and generating garbles. \
\
Players can explore their surroundings to collect eggs, waste material and other useful scrap items. All these items can be minted as NFT in the game wallet. Ultimately, all trash items can be combined to give birth to an army of adorable, trash-eating Garbles. To generate the little creatures a [Transmuter](../resources/#transmuter) is required. Trasmuters are powerful machines that can turn the different types of garbage into the hungry creatures, provided it is energized with enough [$NUCLEAR](../resources/#nuclear). The process requires at least an egg and three trash objects, all to be found around our polluted world. The reaction will remove actual CO2 from the environment. After having assembled a litter of garbles, players can take part in [raids](raid.md) against nasty piles of trash that may occasionally spawn in the middle of their city and play daily mini-games to collect [Resources](../resources/) and exciting [Rewards](../resources/game-items/). \
